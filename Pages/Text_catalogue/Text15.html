                <p> Colin Crumplin's one-man exhibition at Garage was chosen from three groups of his work, the earliest
                    series begun in 1969. This set of reliefs, the White Pieces, some of which were shown in 'Basically
                    White' at the ICA, established the mechanics of his investigation which centered on using chance to
                    determine the final image. In the first case a given number of grains of rice were sprinkled on
                    white surfaces in order to decide the position of small drilled holes. The procedure explored
                    repetition, with both random and geometric sequences occurring within a single area. The Card
                    Pieces, begun in December 1974, repeated the idea of dropping objects onto a neutral surface.
                    However after the cards were dropped and traced according to a predetermined programme, the
                    resulting diagrams served as models for three-dimensional constructions. These constructions,
                    consisting of a conglomeration of glued wooden rectangles which overlapped in a physical sense, were
                    hung directly onto the walls. Looking critically over these series at what was achieved by working
                    according to such a fixed procedure (theory, drawing, object) it seems that the main benefit is the
                    effect on the viewer. He is more likely to be stimulated into unraveling the incidents leading to
                    the final piece and thereby specifically consider the thought process of the artist.
<br><br>
                    In the third group of works, an extended sequence of drawings entitled Hommage a Queneau, Crumplin
                    again developed the variations of a constant subject. Here the individual examples, pencil sketches
                    of a cup, embodied different artistic styles presumably chosen entirely by human will. Contrary to
                    the two previous series the set of possible permutations was in fact a large but finite group,
                    namely all the recognizable, historic styles identifiable by the average viewer which the artist had
                    the desire to depict. In a useful handout which Crumplin wrote for the exhibition he explicitly
                    acknowledged a) the inspiration for the series; b) the event which led to his choice of subject
                    matter. The idea was adopted from Raymond Queneau's book Exercises in Style in which the author
                    explores the variety of meanings/characters a single story takes on when told from different
                    viewpoints and in various ways technically. The impetus to work came to Crumplin when he was
                    drinking coffee, hence the choice of an ordinary cup as the subject matter.
                    <br><br>
                    Specifically each drawing possessed at least one of two sorts of information, either a factual
                    statement about the anatomy and sociology of the coffee cup and/or an imitation of the style of a
                    recognised draughtsman or school. Both sorts of information could be eventually linked to the known
                    source. From the beginning the viewer would know he was looking for the cup in each of the 12 in
                    squares, and secondly he would soon begin looking for the twist. In fact most of the anonymous
                    styles came either from Basic Design, for instance the radial cross-section of a cup, or else from
                    advertising. In the incidents where it was the style as such that was the motivation for the work,
                    for example the imitations of Seurat and Patrick Caulfield, Crumplin had a way of exaggerating their
                    gestures so that the viewer was ultimately conscious of the gulf between all fakes and all
                    originals.
                    <br><br>
                    In the cases where the viewpoint represented contained a sociological bias the selection of
                    locations was also narrowed by the artist's personal inclinations. Crumplin habitually settled on an
                    uncluttered situation compatible with an emphatic separation of background and subject. There even
                    emerged a characteristic dry wit with which the fashions of art school teachings were intermixed
                    with sketches mimicking the standards of commercial art. For instance the series contained both the
                    hackneyed exercise of a continuous line drawing and an imitation of a Royal Douiton brochure.
                    <br><br>
                    Even in this rather complex series the strength of Crumplin's work remained its ability to give
                    intriguing clues about his procedures and thinking which very naturally led the viewer to speculate
                    on the artist's aims and subjectivity. The notion that it is an asset to a good work of art to be at
                    the same time didactic, has not always been popular nor understood. In the small exhibition Michael
                    Compton chose for the Arts Council, Art as Thought Process, the aesthetic level of the art
                    demonstrated that problem-solving and an ordered procedure were integral to the final statement. In
                    the catalogue introduction he pointed out that the exhibits shared what amounted almost to a
                    self-deprecating attitude; they used a shield of anonymity which was manifested either in the use of
                    ideas of apparent banality, or of images associated with the style of another artist. In some cases
                    this facade was preserved only to underline a simple subtlety, which would inevitably emerge when to
                    the spectator became aware of the direct connection between the idea for the work of art and the
                    actual physical shape and character of the object. Up until now Crumplin has worked with methods
                    already associated with an older generation, in particular Kenneth Martin and the Systems group, and
                    an assessment of his work is bound to suffer from their, precedent. While his work is in no way a
                    slick imitation of these styles the Card Pieces have an uncanny resemblance to Kenneth Martin's
                    series Chance and Order, mainly because of the clustering of short lines in organic matrices. For
                    both artists the final product has mysterious and iconographic qualities not suggested in the
                    preliminary drawings. In Crumplin's piece ‘III, 72.7' the separate stratas, those groups of sticks
                    which had been dropped during a particular interval, were identified by a uniform colour,
                    black/grey/brown. In addition a pair of each of the figures resulting from dropping the rectangles
                    within a given area were reproduced in isolation and displayed to the right of the main
                    configuration. From a distance the visual importance of the various depths as a measure of work-time
                    was reduced, allowing the starkness of the quirky silhouette to take priority over the theoretical
                    side of the piece. Indeed, some of the configurations resembled real objects: in ‘///’ an anchor
                    shape stood out by itself. It is obvious both Kenneth Martin and Colin Crumplin take extreme care in
                    making adjustments to their formulae and in the selection of which works are brought to a finished
                    state from among the haphazard raw ingredients produced from the system. Their work triumphs
                    visually because of this.
