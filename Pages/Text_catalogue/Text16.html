                <p> Colin Crumplin's first one man show, at Garage in Earlham Street, of paintings, drawings and
                    watercolours and wall hanging constructions is thoughtful, thought-provoking and fascinating. Some
                    of it is alarmingly refined: white paintings in a complex of varied shapes, each surface dotted with
                    minute holes which reflect a procedure dependant on both worked out structure and chance. There are
                    mirrored images, repeated and serial images grids, tracings. Drawings of a coffee cup grew out of
                    Raymond Queneau's “Exercises in Style” in Barbara Wrights brilliant translation, in which the same
                    story is told ninety -nine different ways. The coffee cup is presented in a variety of different
                    technical drawings, drawings as art school exercises,drawings as fanciful and realistic. The subject
                    is the same :but the way in which style affects meaning is fetchingly explored.
