                    Chaos theory suggests that the flutter of a butterfly's wing can cause a tornado. Colin Crumplin's
                    paintings also rely on chance. Yet while the initial impetus may be generated by an event as random
                    as the butterfly's fluttering wing, his subsequent workings involve choice, selection and editorial
                    intervention. Chance and choice are, therefore, yoked together to create the inherent tension within
                    his work.
                    <br><br>
                    The Surrealists often set, in startling juxtaposition, banal and unrelated objects, not so much to
                    create unreal and dream-like scenarios, but to heighten the compelling reality of the external
                    world. As the poet Breton wrote, their aim was "to resolve the previously contradictory conditions
                    of dream and reality into an absolute reality" - arguably what, some fifty odd years later,
                    Baudrillard would call a 'hyperreality'. While Dadaists such as Arp were more interested in chance -
                    tearing up a drawing and letting the fallen pieces dictate a composition - the Surrealists drew
                    heavily on Freud's theories about dreams and the subconscious in their pursuit of spontaneous
                    creation. Automatism was used to penetrate the controlling rational super-ego and explore the
                    primitive, spontaneous id. Looking at his early frottages - rubbings first taken from worn floor
                    boards - Paul Eluard was surprised by the sudden intensification of his "visionary capacities and by
                    the hallucinatory succession of contradictory images superimposed, one upon the other".
                    <br><br>
                    Colin Crumplin does not take rubbings of the floor - though one can imagine him being just as
                    excited as Eluard by the suggested possibilities of his random marks - and discounts an over
                    surrealist reading of his work, saying that he is not really interested in revealing his
                    subconscious or anything specifically autobiographical. Yet working flat on the floor and spreading
                    acrylic paint onto lengths of unstretched cotton duck, there are ways in which his concerns do
                    overlap with the surrealist enterprise, just as much as they take a passing nod in the direction of
                    Pollock and the influence on his work of the seemingly intuitive marks and traces found in the sand
                    paintings of indigenous American Indians. Whilst for Crumplin chance is the philosophical
                    underpinning behind evolution and life's seemingly random pattern, he rejects the use of chance as
                    some sort of mystical yardstick, pointing to the way-in which, for example, John Cage relied on the
                    I Ching . It might be argued that the juxtaposition of the abutted images in his diptychs rather
                    reflects the eclecticism of a post-modern culture where objects are merely signs, none with a
                    greater value or weight than any other.
                    <br><br>
                    After covering half the canvas with acrylic paint by hand, he then flips over the uncovered portion
                    to form a blind mono-print (the equivalent of a child's butterfly ink blot). The resulting marks are
                    then 'read', (think of patterns left by frost on window panes, or tea leaves at the bottom of a cup)
                    and the image suggested used as the starting point for a new painting in oils. These embryonic
                    'beginnings' are photographed and carried around in a small notebook like precious intimate objects
                    until they 'speak' to him. A second canvas often the same size is then stretched and an image
                    suggested by the first projected onto it. This may have been found in a picture library, a magazine
                    or simply by a chance thumbing through a random book, or be a photograph taken by himself. Unlike
                    its expressionistic and playful d oppelganger , the second 'hyperreal' painting is executed in
                    meticulous detail in oil -the paint of artifice and illusion -rather than quick drying acrylic. The
                    two halves set up a dialectical tension as if between the left and right sides of the brain. A
                    series of oppositions is established; a dialogue between the cognitive and the intuitive, the
                    primitive id and the civilising super-ego, the fluid and the constructed, the child and adult. It is
                    as if each half needs the other, as in any good relationship, to become more than simply itself.
                    <br><br>
                    The tension between the two halves, each of which is interdependent and bound to the other like a
                    pair of Siamese twins, also poses questions about intention, about which is the 'truer' or 'real'
                    image. Do we automatically assume that the second, 'finished' painting is somehow more 'real', or
                    that the first carries some deeper, expressive truth which is then veiled by the stylised artifice
                    of the second image? Copying formed the basis for most traditional art education but by the sixties
                    had given way to a greater emphasis being placed on individualistic expression. Again these works
                    challenge notions of where value resides. The finding of that initial image within the blur of the
                    mono-print involves a suspension of the critical analytic self. Its reading is akin to an act of
                    daydreaming, to the child finding dragons and castles in the changing shapes of clouds or faces in
                    tongues of fire.
                    <br><br>
                    For most of his career this dialogue between parts has been the basis for Crumplin's work. In the
                    '80s he used plaster to fix gestures made by the sweep of the hand or a foot, which he called first
                    events. These would then, without any particular selection process, be used as catalysts to make
                    companion objects, employing methods that were generally much slower such as casting. Paintings were
                    created by dropped, smeared or smudged marks which were then copied. In the Coincidence drawings
                    Crumplin has said that he followed "a strictly systematic process which determines how copies are
                    displaced or reoriented in relation to the blot's original position. The blot and copy sequence
                    continues until by chance, an overlap of a predetermined kind occurs." The parameters of these
                    self-reflexive paintings, were, in a sense, semantic. This was art about art - art literally
                    mirroring back its own shadowed presence.
                    <br><br>
                    Whilst the newer paintings continue in full awareness of this debate there is a broader resonance,
                    an opening up and a move away from the previously more contained aesthetic. Crumplin's basic palette
                    is simple: ultramarine, spectrum yellow, spectrum red and black. Sometimes these are all tipped a
                    bucket and not stirred but simply poured, so that each colour finds its own relationship with the
                    other, without being mixed or muddied, on the canvas. In Orchid 1996 (page 19) white was added. The
                    result is a rich Pollock-like 'first painting' where the colours are clear and bright, spreading
                    into a sunset-coloured fan that is then transliterated into a sexually inviting orchid that is part
                    botanically accurate image from a coffee table gardening book and part Georgia O'Keeffe. As with the
                    painting Eyebrow 1995 (page 18), an intimate portrait of his wife the painter Maria Lalic, Crumplin
                    claims the closely observed detail is in part due to years of peering close up at subjects because
                    of his short sight.
                    <br><br>
                    These latest paintings also begin to question the much rehearsed adage that painting is dead, that
                    it has become so bereft of possibility that it can do nothing other than represent itself. Whilst
                    all the works are certainly 'self generated', a painting such as Bridge 1997 (page 13) raises a
                    number of wider issues rather than simply continuing the debate on art for art's sake. The 'first'
                    'blind' painting, in black and white, has the quality of a cheaply printed map or city plan. The
                    'second' is, in fact, based on a grainy postcard showing bomb damage to a bridge in Cologne in 1945.
                    It is the same bridge that it is now necessary to cross to get to from the main town to the site of
                    the Cologne art fair. Implicit in the work are questions concerning art's 'bridging' or unifying
                    role, its power and strength to restore, to close cultural gaps. These echo the references embedded
                    in the earlier painting, Flood 1996 (page 23), the lower image of which is taken from the Time Life
                    book of Floods and depicts that great destructive threat to artistic treasures, the '60s flood in
                    Florence.
                    <br><br>
                    In two paintings done this year an interesting change is occurring whereby the distinction between
                    the two halves of the diptych is becoming blurred. An image of an X-ray taken by Crumplin's
                    chiropractor to detect a trapped nerve forms the bottom half of a small work and follows up in a
                    direct physical relationship to the rib-like structure created in the first canvas. The two halves
                    stand, not so much as separate and related parts, but as an intended whole. The second, constructed
                    image seems looser, less self-conscious, more akin to the first, dreamingly expressionistic like
                    some shimmering milky way. This communion or coming together is most apparent in Shingles 1997 (page
                    25), a stunningly resolved and beautiful painting that is a literal depiction of the horrendous rash
                    caused by shingles, but which, at the same time, is an image resonant with metaphor. We might be
                    looking at a Turner sunset or the flayed back of Christ. One immediately thinks of Bacon's obsession
                    with the diseased mouth. Here, after the long and experimental process of exploring dichotomy,
                    cacophony and difference is a painting which celebrates synthesis, a coming together. It is as if
                    the long dissension between reason and intuition has become resolved, harmonised into a holistic
                    totality.
