                <p>Colin Crumplin makes two-part painting which reverse the usual process of abstracting from reality by
                    taking a chance-driven abstract starting point and then finding something figurative in reality to
                    match it. This builds the world's unpredictability into the process and provides a dynamic and
                    innovative way of staging modern painting's typical contest between form and content. Crumplin has
                    developed this format over many years, his colours becoming more mixed, and the subjects in the
                    figurative part of the paintings increasingly being developed from more public sources, and touching
                    on political issues.
<br><br>
                    <b>You use chance in a very interesting way. Could you describe how you begin?</b><br>
                    I start with cotton duck canvas and acrylic paint, which I see as the means of a certain kind of
                    high modernism and as a way of making an image quickly, as the paint can be handled easily. I staple
                    cotton duck to the floor in a double square shape, wet it, and pour acrylic paint on to it from a
                    bucket with all the colours I'll be using in it together - violet, green and orange for example. The
                    paint is quite thick, so the mixing occurs on the cotton duck. I spread the paint quickly using my
                    hand to cover the surface of one half of the double square and fold the other half of the canvas
                    over and blind print it by wiping a piece of cardboard across the back. I then open the canvas and
                    leave it to dry.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Do you attempt to direct the paint with your hand?</b><br>
                    No, because the point is to make something which will surprise me. But the process does often lead
                    to an element of symmetry at first. The pouring is essential: I've tried other means of starting,
                    preferably to make it more accidental, perhaps by moving away from the folding across, but so far I
                    haven't found them rich enough.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>How many of these starts do you make?</b><br>
                    I make quite big sets all at the same time. It can take years to make use of a start, and at the
                    moment I have around 60 ready to use.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>You then copy a photographic image which matches the start in some way. How does that come about?</b><br>
                    I work from photographs of the starts. I also collect images - mostly, at the moment, photographs
                    from newspapers or photographs which I have taken. I make maquettes for my two-part works from
                    photocopied and resized photographs of each part. The imagery can be arbitrary. For example an
                    assistant suggested I use an orange start, for which I grew a lily, and photographed and collaged it
                    as the basis for a painting. And I started painting injuries when a friend gave me some images of a
                    shark bites he thought would interest me.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>There are literary parallels with your use of chance with the work of Raymond Roussel and the Oulipo
                        group of French writers. Is that relevant to you?</b><br>
                    My interest in the French literature of chance goes back a long way. I see that approach as rooted
                    in the 60s. Stemming from the music of Cage - I liked distancing strategies like the way the
                    structure in Roussel's Impressions of Africa (1910) is the frame for the content. In 1977, I
                    published Hommage a Queneau, which takes as its starting point his Exercises in Style (1947 - the
                    same anecdote told in 99 different ways) and applied it to drawings of a cup.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Have you ever shown one side of a painting without the other?</b><br>
                    I liked the Abstract Expressionist kind of painting which I grew up with, but it seemed based on
                    judgements I didn't understand - I didn't trust that Greenbergian 'fine judgement'. The left-hand
                    sides of my work could look like a homage to that, but although it's been suggested I try separating
                    the two sides, for me it only work with the pictorial element - they're a bit like a long sentence
                    with a colon in the middle: I like the disjunction. I did a long time ago make paintings which
                    copied across an abstract element, but that seemed a discussion very internal to painting.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>How did the picture of your wife's eye come about?</b><br>
                    I saw an eyebrow in the start, and made a photograph of her to match it. The more recent eye
                    painting - Eye (Subconjunctival Haemorrhage) - is of a condition I had, which looked much more
                    dramatic than it was.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>What about the painting of caribou?</b><br>
                    I was looking for the right antlers for a long time after the start for Oil (Caribou
                    Migrating:Alaska) - I called it that because oil pipes were threatening their migration paths at the
                    time.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Have you ever come across an image you like and tried to make a start to match it?</b><br>
                    I suppose it could be done but then it wouldn't surprise me. Similarly, an obvious reading is that
                    it relates to psychological approaches like say the Rorschach test, but it isn't interesting to me
                    that it's mine. If someone says what a cloud looks like, we don't use that to explain their
                    personality. It's true that you can see more than one shape in a start - and some starts have had
                    various possible subjects - but I guess I don't know nor much care why one subject gets chosen.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Would you agree that there is quite a lot of violence in your work?</b><br>
                    Yes, and it's impossible not to think of those things as being interpreted and metaphoric. The shark
                    bite painting puts me in mind of late medieval paintings of flayings, which are simultaneously
                    horrendous and gorgeous in how they are painted. But in the end I am seeking a pretext for a
                    painting. It isn't about illustrating a particular war or something.
