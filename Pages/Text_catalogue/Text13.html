                <p> One of the problems of running a gallery is who to select and why, particularly, as is the case of
                    Anthony Stokes' new gallery in Langley Court WC2, the space, however sympathetic, is restricted.
                    Colin Crumplin is the perfect choice as the work is of such a nature and size as to positively
                    benefit from the space and atmosphere; would that more galleries might take note! This new gallery
                    has a ground floor and a basement which allow more than twenty five of Crumpling's paintings and
                    drawings have adequate viewing room. The show has a dialectic essay-like feel, as though one is
                    being gently instructed in how the artist thinks about the act of making paintings, and what he
                    chooses to show as a result of that thinking.
<br><br>
                    The work concerns a dialogue between the creation of visually spontaneous marks, spatters, dribbles
                    and the examination by imitation of those marks.The end result is both a visual and intellectual
                    juxtaposition.This work has precedents in Johns and even Lichtenstein: but its originality lies in
                    the way the paintings are made by spreading, folding and blotting the paint, and then tracing those
                    methods carefully and recreating them as a slightly modified copy in a variety of styles from
                    Impressionism to Pointillism. Works such as 'Fold and Spread' illustrate this well by emphasising
                    how the paint has a delicious quality when its overall look is carefully copied.
                    <br><br>
                    The seductive aspect of Crumplin's work is the actual paint handling, which, in itself, might amply
                    suffice for other painters. He has a deliberate and sensual way of using the substance which
                    sometimes distracts from the point of making the pun. In fact when he makes good paintings per se
                    they are often spoiled by that side of the work. 'Black to White' is a case in point. It is
                    intelligently and sympathetically made using monochrome, as the title implies, and looks literally
                    delicious. But, appended at the top edge, is a smaller rather awkwardly connected connected pastiche
                    version that frankly detracts from what might otherwise be a stunning painting. By using this visual
                    duality one has to constantly to readjust the criteria with which to look at the work. On the one
                    hand it is serious colour painting , and on the other hand it is some kind of art historical
                    commentary: consequently there is always there is always an unsettling but definitely intriguing
                    conflict. This is , however, their ultimately strength; the two elements are necessary.
                    <br><br>
                    While Crumplin has been making these paintings, since the beginning of 1972, he has produced a
                    series of drawings which are published in book called 'Homage a Queneau' ( Anthony Stokes Ltd). It
                    contains a set of one hundred pencil drawings of cups, all carried out in various pastiche,
                    parodying styles, ranging from Picasso through Scott to Dine. These are witty and slightly posed
                    statements about the meaning and relevance of mannerisms and styles. The most amusing aspect is that
                    he obviously got involved in the in this intellectual fraud because he enjoyed the freedom of
                    deciding means and subjects in advance, rather than because of an intended comment on the artists he
                    chose to parody. The idea of such a book was inspire by Raymond Queneau's 'Exercises in Style' (
                    published in 1947) in which Queneau told he same anecdote in a variety of ways. Somehow one feels
                    that the notion a book is preferable to trying to do a similar thing in painting.
