                    <p>Colin Crumplin is a painter who has had solo shows in London, Brussels, at MOMA Oxford, the John
                        Hansard Gallery in Southampton, Arnolfini in Bristol and galleries in Salisbury, Cheltenham,
                        Brussels and Bath and he has taken part in group shows throughout Britain and in Milan, Luzern
                        and
                        New York. He has curated shows in London, Southampton and Switzerland.
                        <br><br>
                        His work is in many collections including those of the Arts Council, British Council, Cecil
                        Higgins
                        Art Gallery, Contemporary Art Society, Creasey, Swindon Museum and Art Gallery, Russell Coates,
                        Saatchi, Southampton City Art Gallery and Ulster Museum and Art Gallery.
                        <br><br>
                        Almost all his work starts with a swifltly made chance-based event which is then paired with a
                        slowly constructed image or object 'suggested' by the first event.
                        <br><br>
                        In the case of paintings, a folded 'blot' is paired with a painted image typically made from a
                        remembered image from his archive of press photographs or from photographs he has made himself.
                        <br><br>
                        Earlier works used chance methods to constuct images operating at the limits of perception
                        whilst
                        others constitute a compendium of references and styles of painting and drawing.
                        <br><br>
                        Born in Hertfordshire in 1946, he studied in Leicester and at Chelsea and the Slade and taught
                        at
                        several schools of art, principally Bath Academy of Art – now Bath Spa University – latterly as
                        Reader in Fine Art.
